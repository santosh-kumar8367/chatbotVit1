						RAYMOND MAYWEATHER AND HUFFEMUP ISLAND 
                                                                        by Daniel Errico
Raymond Mayweather tuned up his ship.
He checked every, latch and he fixed every drip.
It was time for his voyage to deep outer space.
As always he hoped to find some unknown place.
Raymond flew his ship up and out of the Earth’s atmosphere. He flew past Saturn’s rings and beyond the icy Pluto. After flying for a long time he came upon a small planet, and decided it was time to go exploring.
The planet was made up of two islands, separated by an ocean. One island was very colorful and the other was brown and dull. Raymond set his ship down on the shore of the colorful island.
He saw a large creature sleeping on the beach. It had a big belly and looked like it had been sleeping for at least a day. 
“Excuse me,” said Raymond as he approached the large creature.
The large creature just snored.
“Ahem, Excuse me!” said Raymond a little bit louder.
The large creature just rolled over.
